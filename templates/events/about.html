      <h1>About the website</h1><br/><br/>
      <p >College Events website is a web-application which displays the current departmental, club and community events happening at
        Vasavi College of Engineering. The application is responsive, robust and reliable and is developed to overcome the obfuscation in the
        current college website.</p><br/>
      <p >The website can be viewed in three modes: Organiser mode and participant mode and spectator mode. The organisers have
        the privilege toadd an event to the website which is accessible to all other users. They can also add participants to the event. The participant has
        the privilege to view the events they are enrolled in and can ask queries in the noticeboard. The spectators can only view the event details
        of the event and do not require any login.The web-application has three sections: The navbar which contains tabs to view the current events categorized
         by sections,a tab to contact the organiser, a tab which displays the information about each event and a home button which would redirect the website to
        its homepage. The footer contains the social account and contact information of the developers.
      </p><br/>
      <p >The back-end of the web-application is developed using Django framework. The front-end of the web-application is developed
         using HTML5, CSS and Bootstrap. It handles the databases, forms, login, etc. Few libraries like AllAuth are used to integrate the userâ€™s login with
          their Google account., which would notify the users by delivering an email in their inbox, regarding any updates on the events.
